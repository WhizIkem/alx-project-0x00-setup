# ALX Frontend Project - 0x00 Setup

This repository contains the setup and source code for a Next.js application built as part of the **ALX Frontend Specialization**. The project is focused on mastering the fundamentals of modern front-end development using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Next.js**.

## Project Description

The application mimics key parts of Airbnb’s UI—property listings, images, and buttons—while teaching best practices in component structure, styling, and scalability using the Pages Router in Next.js.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Scaffold a Next.js project with TypeScript
- Learn folder structure best practices in real-world projects
- Create and type reusable React components
- Implement routing with the Pages Router
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI
- Organize interfaces and props using TypeScript
- Maintain code quality with ESLint
- Understand component composition and modular architecture

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js v13+**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **ESLint**
- **Node.js v16+**

## Best Practices Followed

- Arrow functions and clean code
- Type-safe component interfaces
- Separation of concerns using directories
- Utility-first styling with Tailwind
- ESLint for consistent formatting and rules

## Note

Copy-pasting code might seem faster, but typing it out yourself helps build real understanding. For best results:

- Read and understand instructions carefully
- Write the code manually
- Test and experiment to reinforce learning

> Hands-on practice is key to mastery. Keep coding and stay curious!
